package CodePracticeOne;
/*I want this to be the driver/main class of the package
 * Programs should involve objects, polymorphism, and inheritence
 * Maybe put in an interface or abstract class
 * I would like recursion to be used in at least one method
 * An example would be a war simulation with class people, civilian, soldier, each rank, weapons, methods for deciding who will win a battle, etc. Each soldier can have stats like k/d (or kills if only one death allowed and no come back to life) It will be like a video game
